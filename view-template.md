# *Enter here the name of the view*  

Optionally, describe here in a short paragraph what this view shows.

Add here a diagram. It can be a screen snapshot or whiteboard photo. Follow the [seven tips for design diagrams](seven-tips-design-diagrams.md).
This is typically a *structural diagram* that shows elements and all possible relations between them.

## Element Catalog 
Add here a textual description of elements in the diagram (like a dictionary).
The elements are modules, components, services, nodes, ..., or "boxes" in general in your diagram. 

You don't need to list all elements, only the ones you have important information to provide that is not clear or obvious in the diagram.

Use heading and bulleted lists for improved readability:

#### Element X
- info
- info

#### Element Y
- info
- info

## Behavior 
If applicable, add here one or more *behavior diagrams*, such as sequence diagrams or state diagrams. 

They should complement  the structural diagram shown up-front.
Only important traces should be documented. 

## Related ADRs
If applicable, add links to architecture decision records (ADRs) that describe the rationale for design 
decisions that affect this view. 

Here's a suggested [ADR template](https://github.com/pmerson/ADR-template)

## Related views 
If applicable, add links to parent view, children views, or other related views.

(Parent and child views are result of *refinement*--see [tip #7](seven-tips-design-diagrams.md)).
